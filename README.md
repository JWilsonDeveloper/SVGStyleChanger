# SVGStyleChanger

SVGStyleChanger is a C# application for Windows created in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit), version 17.4.0. Its purpose is to streamline the process of changing the style of all paths within a group of SVG files.

## Background

While working on a project that involved SVG files of symbols, I found myself repeatedly needing to modify the color of these symbols. This involved editing each SVG file individually, which was time-consuming and inefficient. To address this issue, I developed this application.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine, or download the zip file and extract its contents.
2. Navigate to the publish folder (\SVGStyleChanger\bin\Release\net6.0\win10-x64\publish)
3. Run the application SVGStyleChanger
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the target SVG files and customize the style.
5. If you're having trouble, consider watching the demo video.
